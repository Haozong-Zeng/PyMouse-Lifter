# PyMouse-Lifter
This repository contains the codes and documents of the "PyMouse-Lifter: Real Time 3-D Pose Estimation for Mice with Only 2-D Annotation Via Data Synthesis" project in Dr. Tim Murphy's Lab at UBC.
## Blender
This folder contains the Blender projects for automated data synthesis. To run the Python scripts in Blender, please install the dependencies in Blender's own Python environment.
## Depth Anything
This folder contains everything you need from getting pseudo labels, fine-tuning models, and doing real-time behavior classification. Synthetic & real datasets are being compressed and uploaded; coming soon.
## PyMouse Lifter Classification
This folder contains the codes and data to validate the behavioral classifiers mentioned in the paper.
## LED delay measurement
This folder contains the codes and data to validate the delay & FPS estimation with flashing LEDs. To replicate the experiment, go to Depth Anything folder.
